\title{Solves a plain Markov decision process with randomized policies.}
\usage{
solve_mdp_rand(mdp, discount, algorithm = "mpi", policy_fixed = NULL,
  maxresidual = 0.001, iterations = 10000L, timeout = 300,
  output_tran = FALSE, show_progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{algorithm}{One of "mpi", "vi", "vi_j", "pi"}

\item{policy_fixed}{States for which the  policy should be fixed. This
should be a dataframe with columns idstate, idaction, probability.
 The policy is optimized only for states that are missing, and the
 fixed policy is used otherwise}

\item{maxresidual}{Residual at which to terminate}

\item{iterations}{Maximum number of iterations}

\item{timeout}{Maximum number of secods for which to run the computation}

\item{output_tran}{Whether to construct and return a matrix of transition
probabilites and a vector of rewards}

\item{show_progress}{Whether to show a progress bar during the computation}
}
\value{
A list with value function policy and other values
}
\description{
The method can be provided with a randomized policy for some states
and the output policy is randomized.
}
